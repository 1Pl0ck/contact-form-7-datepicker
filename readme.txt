Datepicker for Contact Form 7 Wordpress Plugin based on jsDatePick script.

== Description ==

Implements a new **[date]** tag in Contact Form 7 that adds a date field to a form. When clicking the field a calendar pops up enabling your site visitors to easily select any date.
To use, just insert the **[date your-field-name]** or **[date* your-required-field-name]** to any form in Contact Form 7 edit area where you want users to input a date.

This plugin is somewhat a fork of [Contact Form 7 Calendar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cf7-calendar/) by [harrysudana](http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/harrysudana/).
